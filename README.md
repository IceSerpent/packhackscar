1.9 percent of Americans suffer from paralysis, meaning roughly 5.4 million people who can’t walk, write, or ever have any form of interactive entertainment. In today’s world, almost all American children play videogames, and our project brings these same experiences to those who are paralyzed. We have created a game that relies solely on head motion. The game is a car racing/dodging game, which is operated by tilting the user’s head to operate the car.  To do this, we used a combination of the OpenCV library, the Google Cloud Vision API, Pygame, and the python Multithreading Pool. The game0i	 With more development, we can add more features including powerups and perhaps a nitro boost. We can also further experiment with different forms of head rotation.
